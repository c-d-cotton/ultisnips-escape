# Introduction
A script for escaping text so it runs correctly with UltiSnips. This means that you can write documents in their normally format and then convert them into UltiSnips. This is useful with my project common-section which matches and replaces sections of a standard format and wouldn't match text that is already escaped in UltiSnips.
